# BasicDevEnv

This repository contains shell scripts to set up a basic development evironment
in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for developers working principally with Ruby and Javascript
libraries including Rails, Node.js, React.js among others.

The packages included not only basic CLI tools like tree, openssh-server, etc.,
but also most of the commonly used tools for productive developement.

Be forewarned: This setup is highly customized for the use of Vim.
